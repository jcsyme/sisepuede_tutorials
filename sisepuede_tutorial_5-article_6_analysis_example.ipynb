    "# Peru SISepuede Article 6 – Full Tutorial Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to help you and other users generate simulations to support Article 6 analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the overall workflow used to construct, transform, and run SISepuede inputs for Peru\n",
    "- See how directory paths, data files, and model attributes are configured\n",
    "- Follow how the Peru input dataframe is built from pipeline output and example data\n",
    "- Learn how the Transformers / Transformations / Strategies machinery is initialized\n",
    "- See where helper CSVs (inputs and attributes) are written for cloud/batch use\n",
    "- Understand how the high-level `SISEPUEDEModels` runner is constructed and used\n",
    "- Inspect additional exploratory, validation, and debugging cells in context\n",
    "\n",
    "You can safely run the notebook from top to bottom.  \n",
    "When turning this into a streamlined workflow later, you can focus on the cells marked as\n",
    "*core workflow* and consider removing or skipping those marked as primarily *exploratory*.\n",

    "## How to Adapt This Notebook for New Runs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the underlying SISepuede logic does **not** change, adapting this notebook for\n",
    "new countries, datasets, or scenarios mainly involves adjusting:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. File Paths and Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Update paths in the early setup cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`path_git`**  \n",
    "  (location of your SISepuede repositories)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data file paths:**  \n",
    "  - `path_data_calib`  \n",

    "  - `path_data_built`  \n",
    "  - Repository paths (if used)\n",
    "\n",
    "These must point to the correct locations for your machine and your region.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Country / Region Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt the workflow for a different country:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change ISO codes from `\"PER\"` to the appropriate ISO-3 (e.g., `\"TZA\"`).\n",
    "- Update any hard-coded region identifiers or filters.\n",
    "- Confirm that the input file contains only the regions you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the logic stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Reusing the Transformation Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the example in **cell 24** (the `transformation_general` example) as a template.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define new levers, modify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model variable**  \n",

    "- **Strategy ID**\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure does not change — only the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Export New Helper Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare your environment for external runs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reuse the export logic that writes  \n",
    "  - `attribute_dim_time_period.csv`  \n",
    "  - `input_data_peru_base.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "When adapting to a new country, these files will contain **your region’s attributes and input data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Run Models and Compare Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the existing examples as patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AFOLU runs**  \n",
    "  to sanity-check sector-specific behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Full SISepuede runs**  \n",
    "  to evaluate complete scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "For strategy runs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tie together your **strategies** (from the transformations directory)\n",
    "- Plug in transformed inputs or use a **scenario manager**\n",
    "- Compare outputs across scenarios to understand impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
